2025-06-11 13:33:37,336 - root - INFO - Returning summary: The paper investigates the v-numbers of powers of monomial ideals and their integral closures in a polynomial ring. It offers an alternative proof for determining the v-numbers of powers of complete intersection monomial ideals and explores the relationship between v-numbers associated with integral closure filtrations of irreducible monomial ideals and the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity. The results show that the v-numbers of powers of ideals can be larger than the v-numbers of integral closures of their powers. The paper also provides computations and bounds for v-numbers in specific cases, showcasing the complexity and connections of v-numbers with various algebraic and combinatorial structures.

2025-06-11 13:33:44,081 - root - INFO - Received result from server: The paper titled "v-numbers of integral closure filtrations of monomial ideals" explores the v-numbers related to powers of monomial ideals and their integral closures within a polynomial ring. It presents a new proof for calculating the v-numbers of powers of complete intersection monomial ideals. The study examines the connections between v-numbers linked to integral closure filtrations of irreducible monomial ideals and the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity. Notably, it reveals that the v-numbers for powers of ideals can exceed those of the integral closures of their powers. The research includes computations and establishes bounds for v-numbers in certain instances, highlighting the complexity and interrelations of v-numbers with diverse algebraic and combinatorial structures.
